## About me 
In November 2024, I completed my successive master-doctor program at the School of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology (HFUT, China), under the supervision of Prof. Shixin Zhu. 
I then continued my visiting scholar experience for about four months under the supervision of Prof. Shixin Zhu. 
From Arpil 2025, I I worked as a research fellow (postdoc) at Nanyang Technological University, working under the supervision of Prof. San Ling. 

## Research Interests 
My research interests primarily focus on algebraic coding theory, quantum information theory, and mathematical problems in Cryptography.
